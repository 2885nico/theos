# theos' docs
here you'll find anything and everything related to the documentation of the project. most of the images are broken, but i dont really care. i probably won't be fixing any of those, i'm sorry.

## structure
in this directory you will find the general documentation. the in-depth docs can be found in my notes at docs/COURSE-NOTES. there you'll find almost anything and everything you might be looking for.
